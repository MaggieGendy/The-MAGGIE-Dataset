MAGGIE is organized into 75 table-pairs (in the form of CSVs), such that each user has two data-tables (one from Mobile 
specificaions and sensors folder and the other from Users profiles folder) containing user-related data, 
Device and Battery-related time series Data, and Sensors-related Data. Each of these two tables has a unique ID, we used
the Android ID that is uniquely and permanently given to each smart phone manifactured.
The first data-table contains the following data: 
• Battery Percentage.
• Battery Health status.
• Battery Temperature.
• Internet Connection status.
• Charging Status: whether Charging or Not Charging.
• Location: We divided our city into 7 districts in MAGGIE, accordingly, each user takes a district index from 1-7 that represents the location where they were present most of the time.
• Participant’s Gender.
• Participant’s Age Category: We divided the participants into 4 age-categories which are: 18-23, 24-29, 30-35 and others.

The second data-table includes the following information as shown in 2:
• Device model.
• Device Android version .
• Device API Level.
Also, it includes details concerning all the built-in sensors such as:
• Sensors Name: This is a list all the sensors found on the device, more importantly it specifies whether these sensors are
calibrated or not and if they are wake-up sensors, in order to help us understand the acquired measurements.
